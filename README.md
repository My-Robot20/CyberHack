# CyberHack


Hacked a data set to showcase that birthdates should not be used for 4 digit bank pins. Safe security practice. I know it can be difficult 
to remember digits most times. However, formulating a figure digit pattern is a good way to go rather than using birth dates.

Stay safe.

****************************************************
THE PROGRAM : BRUTEFORCEHACK
*****************************************************

This program is developed in C.

The program hacks contact info that exists in the dat file to get possible permutations of the birth year for each contact as a possible 4 DIGIT BANK PIN 
****************************************************


************
Compilation
************
In the terminal, when in the BRUTEFORCEHACK directory, type “ make ”.
This complies all the files in the folder as a Makefile is already created for this purpose. 

***********************
Running the program
***********************
Still in the same directory of the BRUTEFORCEHACK folder, type in “ ./BruteHack ”
This command will run the C program to display the hacks.


********************
DATA: dataFile.dat
********************
Inside the file called dataFile.dat includes the following data.
